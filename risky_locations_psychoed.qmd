### **Spending Time in Risky Places: What It Means for Recovery**

If you’ve recently spent time in a place that felt risky for your recovery—like a bar, a party, a certain neighborhood, or even someone's house—you’re not alone. Recovery doesn’t happen in a bubble. Sometimes you end up in places that remind you of drinking or make it harder to stay sober.

The good news is: just because you were in a risky place doesn’t mean you’ve failed. What matters most is what you **learn** from the experience and what you do **next**.

### **What Makes a Place Risky?**

A **risky location** is any place that makes it more likely for you to drink or think about drinking. These might include:

-    Bars or liquor stores

-    Parties or events where people are drinking

-    Homes or hangouts where you used to drink

-    Workplaces or social events that feel stressful

-    Places tied to strong memories of alcohol use

What’s risky for one person might not be risky for another. What matters is how **you** feel when you’re there.

### **Why Does It Matter?**

Being in risky places can:

-    Trigger cravings or urges to drink

-    Bring back old memories or habits

-    Make you feel out of place or left out

-    Lower your guard when it comes to saying "no"

***Even if you don’t drink, just being in a risky spot can make staying sober harder. That’s why it’s important to check in with yourself after being in one.***

### **Why Do People End Up in Risky Places?**

There are lots of reasons why you might go to a risky place:

-    You didn’t realize it would feel triggering

-    You didn’t want to miss out or disappoint others

-    You thought you could handle it

-    You were caught off guard or didn’t plan ahead

-    You were feeling lonely, bored, or stressed

Again—this happens. The important part is recognizing it and taking steps to protect your recovery going forward.

### **You Can Learn from the Experience**

Spending time in a risky place doesn’t undo your recovery. It’s a chance to learn more about your triggers and prepare better for the future.

Ask yourself:

-    *What made this place feel risky for me?*

-    *How did I feel while I was there?*

-    *What might I do differently next time?*

Being honest about your experience helps you grow stronger and stay in control of your recovery.

### **You’re Still in Charge**

Just because you were in a risky place doesn’t mean you have to stay there—or go back. You’re in control of your choices. You can:

-    Decide not to return to that place

-    Make a plan to bring support with you next time

-    Set boundaries for where you go and for how long

-    Focus on people and places that support your recovery

Recovery is about making decisions that protect your well-being—one step, one choice at a time.

### **Moving Forward from Here**

The following tools and exercises can help you:

-    Reflect on what made the location feel risky

-    Strengthen your boundaries

-    Build a plan for how to handle similar situations in the future

-    Remind yourself why you’re committed to staying sober

**Being in a risky place doesn’t mean you’ve failed—it’s a sign you’re learning, growing, and doing the hard work of recovery. You’ve got this.**
