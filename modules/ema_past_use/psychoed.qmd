# [⚠️](https://emojipedia.org/warning) **Alcohol Use During Recovery**

### **Understanding a Slip or Recent Alcohol Use**

If you’ve recently had a drink or slipped in your recovery, you might be feeling a mix of emotions—guilt, frustration, sadness, or even fear. First, take a deep breath.

A slip does **not** mean you’ve failed. It’s a sign that recovery is still in progress—and that’s okay.

### **Slips Happen in Recovery**

A **slip** is when someone who is trying to stop drinking has a drink after a period of being sober. It can be one drink, or it can last longer. A slip does **not** mean you can’t stay sober—it means there’s more to learn about what makes you want to drink and how to handle those moments. Slips are a COMMON, NORMAL part of recovery and can actually serve as powerful learning moments if you explore them without judgment

### **Why Do Slips Happen?**

Slips can happen for many reasons, such as:

-   **Stress**: When life feels overwhelming or too hard

-   **Strong cravings**: When urges to drink feel too powerful to ignore

-   **Emotions**: Feeling lonely, sad, angry, or even too happy

-    **Triggers**: Being in a place, around certain people, or in a situation where you used to drink

-    **Low confidence**: Thinking “I can’t do this,” or “It’s just one drink, it won’t matter”

***Knowing what led to the slip can help you avoid it in the future.***

### **What Can You Do After a Slip?**

What you do after a slip is what really matters. You don’t have to wait until next week, next month, or after “one last drink” to get back on track. You can restart **right now**. Some helpful actions after slips are:

1.   **Be honest with yourself** – Don’t pretend it didn’t happen. Admitting it helps you move forward.

2.   **Let go of shame** – You made a mistake, but you’re not a failure. Everyone makes mistakes.

3.   **Figure out what led to the slip** – Think about the situation, thoughts, or feelings that came before it.

4.   **Make a plan for next time** – Decide what you’ll do differently if a similar situation comes up again.

5.   **Reach out** – Talk to someone who supports your recovery. You don’t have to go through this alone.

### **What You Tell Yourself Matters**

After a slip, it’s easy to think:

-    “I blew it.”

-    “I have to start all over.”

-    “I’ll never be able to stay sober.”

But these thoughts are not true—and they’re not helpful. Instead, try thinking:

-    “I had a setback, but I’m still moving forward.”

-    “I can learn from this.”

-    “I’m still in recovery, and I’m not giving up.”

### **A Slip Doesn’t Erase Your Progress**

All the work you’ve done so far still counts. One slip doesn’t erase your growth, your effort, or your reasons for wanting to stay sober. You’ve already taken steps toward change—and those steps still matter.

Recovery isn’t about being perfect. It’s about **getting back up** when things get hard. Every time you do that, you build strength.

### **You Can Start Again—Right Now**

You don’t have to wait for a perfect moment. You can restart right now, in this moment. Take a deep breath, and take the next small step.

The tools and exercises that follow are here to help you:

-    Understand what happened

-    Reconnect to your recovery goals

-    Strengthen your plan for staying sober

**You’re not starting over. You’re continuing your journey—stronger, wiser, and more prepared than before.**
