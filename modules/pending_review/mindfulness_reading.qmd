## Introduction to Mindfulness

Mindfulness is the practice of paying attention to the present moment with awareness, curiosity, and acceptance—without judging yourself or your experiences. While it may seem like a new trend, mindfulness is more than 2,500 years old, originating from ancient Buddhist traditions.

### Why Mindfulness Matters

In everyday life, many of us go through our days on automatic pilot, distracted by past regrets, future worries, or constant stimulation from phones, TV, or other activities. When we are on autopilot, we are mindless—not fully aware of what is happening in the present moment.

Mindfulness is about noticing what’s happening right now, including your thoughts, feelings, sensations, and surroundings. It allows you to be present and respond intentionally, rather than reacting automatically.

### A Common Misunderstanding

Some people believe:

*“I don’t want to pay attention to what’s happening right now—it’s too stressful, painful, or scary.”*

This is a normal reaction. Mindfulness does not mean ignoring difficult experiences, but rather observing them with acceptance. Over time, this practice can reduce reactivity, stress, and emotional overwhelm.

### Pause to Reflect

-   When I notice my thoughts wandering, what kinds of things do I most often think about?

-   How aware am I of my body and physical sensations throughout the day?

-   Are there times I notice myself on “autopilot” or going through the day without really paying attention?
