## Thought Stopping Continued

You now know how **Thought stopping** provides a tool for disrupting the trigger → thought → craving → use process<!--refer to thought_stopping_1.qmd-->.

Try the additional techniques below, and use the ones that work best for you:

### 1.  The Stop Command

As soon as you notice a thought about drinking or using, say **“STOP!”** out loud or in your head.

Follow it immediately with a positive replacement thought, like *“I choose recovery”* or *“I am in control.”*

### 2.  Visualize a Stop Sign

Picture a bright red stop sign in your mind when the thought begins.

Hold the image for a few seconds and replace it with a healthy activity you can do instead.

### 3.  Physical Action Interrupt

Snap a rubber band on your wrist, clap your hands, or get up and move.

Physical movement helps break the chain from thought → craving → use.

### 4.  Write It Down

Quickly jot down the thought in a notebook.

Writing externalizes the thought, making it easier to let go and redirect your attention.

### 5.  Engage in a Healthy Replacement Activity

Have a list of activities ready that you can do whenever a thought of using arises. Examples: going for a walk, calling a supportive friend, exercising, or practicing deep breathing.


**Tip:** Thought-stopping is a skill that improves with practice. The earlier you catch a thought, the easier it is to stop before it grows into a craving. Make these exercises part of your daily routine to strengthen your ability to respond to triggers and maintain control over your recovery.
