## ⚠️ Risky Situations and Recovery

In recovery, some situations naturally increase the chance of cravings, slips, or lapses. These are often called risky situations—moments, environments, or experiences that can challenge your sobriety. Recognizing these situations and preparing for them is a key part of staying committed to recovery.

Risky situations don’t mean you have to avoid life or stop enjoying yourself—they simply signal when extra planning, awareness, and coping strategies are needed.

## What Are Risky Situations?

Risky situations are events, places, or circumstances where alcohol is present or where stress or strong emotions make drinking more tempting. Examples include:

- Social gatherings where others are drinking.

- Celebrations, parties, or holidays.

- Being around old drinking friends or favorite drinking spots.

- High-stress moments, arguments, or emotionally intense situations.

- Feeling bored, lonely, or isolated.

Understanding which situations are risky for **you** personally helps you anticipate challenges before they occur.

## Why Does It Matter?

Being in risky places can:

-   Trigger cravings or urges to drink

-   Bring back old memories or habits

-   Make you feel out of place or left out

-   Lower your guard when it comes to saying "no"

Even if you don’t drink, just being in a risky spot can make staying sober harder. That’s why it’s important to check in with yourself after being in one.

## Why Do People End Up in Risky Places?

There are lots of reasons why you might go to a risky place:

-   You didn’t realize it would feel triggering

-   You didn’t want to miss out or disappoint others

-   You thought you could handle it

-   You were caught off guard or didn’t plan ahead

-   You were feeling lonely, bored, or stressed

Again, this happens. The important part is recognizing it and taking steps to protect your recovery going forward.

## How to Navigate Risky Situations

- **Identify Your Triggers:** Make a list of environments, people, or experiences that make drinking more tempting. Awareness is the first step to protection.

- **Plan Ahead:** Think about how you’ll respond before entering a risky situation. Decide on boundaries, exit strategies, and coping tools.

- **Bring Support:** Attend events with a sober friend, mentor, or accountability partner who can help you stay on track.

- **Use Coping Skills:** Practice breathing exercises, mindfulness, urge surfing, or other strategies you know work when cravings arise.

- **Have an Exit Strategy:** Know when and how you can remove yourself from a risky situation if it becomes too tempting.
