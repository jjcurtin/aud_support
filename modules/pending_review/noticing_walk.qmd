## Noticing Walk

Mindfulness means paying attention to the present moment with openness and curiosity. A mindful walk is a simple way to practice this skill. By focusing on your senses, you can gently bring your awareness back to the here and now, calm your mind, and connect with your body.

### Instructions

Go for a walk outside by yourself for 15–20 minutes.

-   Turn off your phone (or leave it at home if possible).

-   Focus on noticing with all your senses, paying attention to what you hear, smell, and see.

#### Step 1: Choose Your Focus

☐ Sounds (noticing near, medium, and far away sounds)\
☐ Smells (pleasant and unpleasant)\
☐ Sights (colors, shapes, sizes, contrasts, sky, ground, surroundings)

You may choose one focus area or explore all three during your walk.

#### Step 2: During Your Walk

-   Notice what you feel in your body as you tune in.

-   Practice acceptance without judgment.

-   If you feel anxious, remind yourself you are safe.
