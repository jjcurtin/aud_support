## 🔄 Slips or Lapses in Recovery

Recovery is rarely a straight line. Many people imagine that once they decide to stop drinking, they’ll never touch alcohol again. But the reality is that **slips** or **lapses** are common experiences. They are moments when someone drinks again after a period of abstinence, even if they had committed to sobriety.

Lapses can feel discouraging—you may feel frustrated, ashamed, or afraid that you’ve “blown it.” But here’s the important truth: a lapse does not erase your progress. It doesn’t mean you’ve failed, and it doesn’t mean you can’t continue building a sober life. In fact, many people who maintain long-term recovery had lapses along the way.

Instead of seeing lapses as the end of recovery, it can help to see them as learning opportunities. Each lapse is a chance to understand your triggers more deeply, strengthen your coping strategies, and recommit to your goals with even more determination.

What matters most is how you respond afterward. A slip can be a setback, but it can also be a valuable learning experience that strengthens your recovery in the long run.

## What is a Lapse?

-   A **lapse** is when you drink briefly after deciding to quit.

-   A **relapse** is when you return to previous drinking patterns for a longer period.

Lapses are not the same as full relapse. They’re moments where you veer off track, but you can still return to your recovery path right away.

## Why Do Lapses Happen?

Lapses often occur in response to:

-   **Triggers:** Being around people, places, or events tied to drinking.

-   **Stress or Emotions:** Using alcohol as a quick way to cope.

-   **Overconfidence:** Thinking, “I can handle just one drink.”

-   **Routine Disruptions:** Vacations, holidays, or unexpected changes in schedule.

Lapses don’t mean recovery isn’t working—they mean you’ve encountered a challenge that needs new coping strategies.

## Healthy Ways to Respond to a Lapse

1.  **Pause and Reflect:** Acknowledge what happened without judgment. Notice what triggered it.

2.  **Reach Out Quickly:** Tell a trusted person—a sponsor, counselor, or friend. Getting support helps you get back on track faster.

3.  **Challenge the “All-or-Nothing” Mindset:** Having one drink doesn’t erase all your progress. Don’t let one slip turn into a full relapse.

4.  **Learn from It:** Ask “What led up to this? What can I do differently next time?” Lapses can highlight weak spots in your recovery plan.

5.  **Recommit to Your Goal:** Each slip is a chance to renew your commitment to sobriety with more insight and strength.

## Remember

Lapses happen to many people in recovery—they are not the end of your journey. Think of them as speed bumps, not roadblocks. What matters most is how quickly you return to your path and what you learn along the way.

Every time you pick yourself back up, you prove your resilience. Recovery is about progress, not perfection.
