## Thought Stopping

To sustain recovery, it is necessary to interrupt the trigger–thought–craving–use sequence<!--refer to trigger_thought_craving_reading.qmd-->. **Thought stopping** provides a tool for disrupting the process.

This process is not automatic. You make a choice either to continue thinking about drinking (and start on the path toward relapse) or to stop those thoughts.


### Techniques

Try the techniques described below, and use those that work best for you:

## 1.  Visualization. 
Imagine a scene in which you deny the power of thoughts of use. For example, picture a switch or a lever in your mind. Imagine yourself actually moving it from ON to OFF to stop the using thoughts. Have another picture ready to think about in place of those thoughts.


**Tip:** Thought-stopping is a skill that improves with practice. The earlier you catch a thought, the easier it is to stop before it grows into a craving. Make these exercises part of your daily routine to strengthen your ability to respond to triggers and maintain control over your recovery.
