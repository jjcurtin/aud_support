## The Importance of Scheduling

Scheduling your time may feel difficult, repetitive, or even boring at first—but it’s one of the most important tools for maintaining recovery from alcohol use. People with alcohol use disorder often struggle to structure their day, and this lack of structure can make it easier to slip back into old habits. By intentionally planning your day, you create a framework that supports your choices and helps you stay on track.

### Why Is Scheduling Necessary?

Recovery often begins in a highly structured environment, such as a hospital program or inpatient treatment. In those settings, the schedule of the program itself helps guide your day and keeps you focused on recovery. Once you are out in the world—whether in outpatient treatment, community programs, or on your own—you are responsible for creating that structure yourself. Your schedule becomes your framework for success, helping you balance responsibilities, self-care, and recovery activities while avoiding high-risk situations.

### Do I Need To Write Down My Schedule?

Yes. Keeping your schedule in your head is usually not enough—thoughts are easy to change on a whim. Writing down your plan helps you commit to your intentions when your rational, goal-focused brain is in control. Following a written schedule encourages you to do what supports your recovery, even when your impulses or cravings push you toward alcohol.

### What If I Am Not an Organized Person?

It’s okay if organization isn’t your natural strength—this is a skill you can develop. Start small with a notebook, planner, or phone calendar, and track your daily activities. Work with a counselor, sponsor, or supportive friend to help you get started. Planning your day in advance trains your mind to follow a structure that reduces opportunities for drinking and builds confidence in your ability to make healthy choices. Remember, your rational brain creates the plan; following it keeps your addicted brain from taking control.

### Who Decides What I Schedule?

You do. Your schedule is for you, though you may include guidance from a counselor, sponsor, or supportive family member. The key is that you commit to what you write down. Following your schedule consistently—even when you don’t feel like it—helps you regain control of your life and strengthens your recovery.

### Starting Small and Building Up

Most people can plan their 24-hour day and follow it. If you can do this consistently, you are already building control and stability. If it feels too difficult at first, consider starting with just a portion of your day and gradually adding more structure. For some, additional support—such as outpatient programs or a higher level of care—may be helpful as a foundation for building effective scheduling habits.
