## Urge Surfing

Urge surfing is a technique for managing your unwanted behaviors. Rather than giving into an urge, you will ride it out, like a surfer riding a wave. After a short time, the urge will pass on its own.

This technique can be used to stop or reduce alcohol use, emotional reactions such as "blowing up" when angry, and other unwanted behaviors.

### How to practice urge surfing

#### 1. Acknowledge you are having an urge.

#### 2. Notice your thoughts and feelings without trying to change or suppress them.

*Note: It is normal to feel some discomfort during an urge.*

#### 3. Remind yourself...

-   It is okay to have urges. They are natural reactions to addictions and habits.

-   An urge is a feeling, not a "must." I can have this feeling and choose not to act.

-   Some discomfort is okay. I don't have to change it.

-   An urge is temporary. Like any other feeling, it will pass on its own.
