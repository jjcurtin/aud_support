## ⚖️ Understanding Ambivalence About Abstinence

When you’re working on recovery, it’s very common to feel ambivalent, or have mixed feelings, about stopping drinking completely. Part of you may want the benefits of abstinence, while another part may miss alcohol or wonder if life without it will be enjoyable. This tug-of-war can feel confusing, but here’s the good news: **ambivalence is a normal and expected part of change**.

The key is not to judge yourself for these mixed feelings, but to understand them and work through them.

## What is Ambivalence?

Ambivalence means holding two opposite thoughts or feelings at the same time. In recovery, it often sounds like:

-   *“I want to quit drinking, but I’ll miss it at parties.”*

-   *“I know alcohol has hurt me, but it helps me relax.”*

-   *“Abstinence feels right, but I’m not sure I can do it.”*

Feeling this push and pull doesn’t mean you’re not serious about recovery. It simply means you’re in the process of making a big change.

## Why Does Ambivalence Happen?

Alcohol often played many roles in your life. It may have been:

-   A stress reliever: something you used to cope with tension.

-   A social tool: a way to connect with friends or feel more comfortable.

-   A reward: something to celebrate or unwind with.

-   A habit: part of your daily or weekend routine.

Giving up alcohol can feel like losing something familiar or comforting, even if it has caused harm. Your brain and emotions are adjusting to this big change, and that naturally brings up conflict.

## Ambivalence is Normal

Almost everyone in recovery experiences ambivalence at some point. It’s not a sign of weakness, it’s part of how people move toward change. Think of ambivalence as standing at a crossroads: one road leads back to drinking, and one road leads to recovery. Feeling uncertain means you’re actively thinking about which path you want to take.

Working through ambivalence is actually healthy—it helps you commit to recovery for reasons that are personal and meaningful to you.

## How Ambivalence Shows Up

-   **Thoughts:** “I can’t imagine never drinking again” or “Maybe I could just cut back instead.”

-   **Emotions:** Anxiety, fear, sadness, or even excitement about change.

-   **Behaviors:** Avoiding making a clear decision, or going back and forth between drinking and stopping.

These experiences don’t mean you’re failing, they mean you’re wrestling with change, which is an important part of recovery.

## Strategies for Working Through Ambivalence

1.  **Pros and Cons List:** Write down what you gain from alcohol vs. what you lose. Then write down what you gain from recovery vs. what you might lose. Seeing it clearly can help tip the balance.

2.  **Focus on Your Values:** Ask yourself: What matters most to me? My health? Family? Work? Future? Then ask: Does alcohol help me live those values—or get in the way?

3.  **Use “Both/And” Thinking:** Instead of judging yourself for mixed feelings, try: “I want to be sober AND I feel scared about it. Both can be true.” This reduces guilt and makes space for self-compassion.

4.  **Talk It Out:** Share your mixed feelings with a counselor, sponsor, or trusted friend. Saying it out loud often makes the conflict feel less overwhelming.

## Remember

Ambivalence is not a roadblock, it’s a stepping stone. By exploring both sides openly, you build insight and motivation that lead to lasting change. Over time, as you experience the benefits of sobriety, your commitment to abstinence will grow stronger and clearer.

Recovery is a journey. It’s okay to take time, wrestle with doubts, and explore your feelings. What matters is that you keep moving forward.
