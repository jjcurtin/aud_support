## Understanding and Identifying Triggers

Triggers are people, places, objects, feelings, and times that can cause cravings. Everyone has triggers. Some are obvious, some are subtle. Being aware of your triggers is an important step in maintaining control over your recovery.

### An Example

If every Friday night someone cashes a paycheck, goes out with friends, and drinks, the triggers might include:

-   Friday night

-   Friends who drink

-   After work

-   A bar or club

-   Money

Your brain associates these triggers with substance use. Over time, even one trigger can prompt thoughts, cravings, and movement toward drinking. This is called the trigger → thought → craving → use cycle, and it can feel overwhelming.

### Steps to Stop the Craving Process

Stopping the craving process is an important part of treatment. The best way to do that is to do the following:

1.  Identify your triggers.

2.  Prevent exposure to triggers whenever possible.

*Example: Do not handle large amounts of cash if money is a trigger.*

3.  Cope with triggers differently than in the past.

*Example: Schedule exercise or a 12-Step/mutual-help meeting for Friday nights.*

**Remember:** Triggers affect your brain and cause cravings even if you’ve decided to stop drinking. Your intentions must translate into behavior changes that help you avoid triggers.

### Reflection

-   What are some of the strongest triggers for you?

-   What particular triggers might be a problem in the near future?

-   What strategies could you use to prevent exposure or cope with these triggers?
