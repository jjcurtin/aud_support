## 🎉 Pleasant Events and Celebration

Pleasant events, or moments that bring enjoyment, relaxation, or connection, are an important part of life. But for someone in recovery, these positive experiences can also be **risky**. Activities that were once paired with drinking, or events where alcohol is present, can trigger cravings, old habits, or the temptation to “just have one.”

Even everyday events, like going out to dinner, attending a concert, celebrating a small achievement, or socializing with friends, can create situations where alcohol feels familiar or tempting. Recognizing that these moments can trigger cravings doesn’t mean you have to avoid them—it means you can plan ahead and protect your sobriety.

Pleasant events are powerful because they activate the brain’s reward system. If alcohol was part of these rewards in the past, your brain may still associate fun, excitement, or relaxation with drinking. This is why enjoyable experiences can sometimes unexpectedly increase risk for a lapse.

## How Pleasant Events Can Trigger Risk

-   **Social Cues:** Seeing others drink or being in environments associated with alcohol.

-   **Routine Associations:** Activities previously paired with drinking, like watching sports, attending happy hours, or celebrating achievements.

-   **Strong Positive Emotions:** Excitement or joy can intensify cravings, especially if alcohol was once part of the celebration.

-   **Disrupted Structure:** Events may involve changes in routine, late nights, or travel, which can weaken coping habits.

## How Risk Shows Up

-   **Thoughts:** “It’s just one drink—everyone else is drinking.”

-   **Emotions:** Excitement, nervousness, or FOMO (fear of missing out).

-   **Behaviors:** Accepting drinks, lingering in triggering environments, or avoiding planned sober strategies.

## Strategies to Protect Recovery During Pleasant Events

-   **Plan Ahead:** Think through where you’ll be, who you’ll be with, and how you’ll respond if alcohol is present. Identify alternative ways to enjoy the event.

-   **Set Clear Boundaries:** Practice polite ways to decline drinks, like: “I’m not drinking tonight, but I’m happy to join the toast with sparkling water.”

-   **Use Sober Supports:** Bring a friend or connect with a sponsor who supports your recovery. Check in before and after the event.

-   **Engage in Enjoyable Activities Without Alcohol:**Focus on the parts of the event you enjoy that don’t involve drinking—music, games, dancing, or conversations.

-   **Stay Mindful of Your Triggers:** Notice thoughts and emotions as they arise. Pause and remind yourself of your recovery goals when cravings appear.

-   **Take Care of Your Body:** Eat, hydrate, and rest before events. Being physically prepared reduces vulnerability to cravings.

## Remember

Pleasant events are not inherently dangerous, but they can trigger cravings or old habits if you’re unprepared. With awareness, planning, and clear strategies, you can enjoy life’s pleasures while staying committed to your recovery. Every sober experience at a pleasant event builds confidence, strengthens coping skills, and reinforces that a fulfilling, alcohol-free life is possible.
