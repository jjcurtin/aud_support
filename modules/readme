1. `features.qmd` contains a table of how features map onto different support categories.


2. The `complete` directory contains all recovery activities ready for deployment (including initial psychoed) as stand-alone qmd files.   

	- This decision to have them in one folder is due to many recovery activities mapping to more than one support category. 
	- activities currently being edited/created are in the `in_progress` directory. 
	- activities that are complete pending review by JC will be put in the `pending_review` directory. 


3. `recovery_activities.csv` contains a list of all recovery activities (including brief description, type of activity, and source of activity) and the support categories each activity maps to.    

	- This file also indicates the activity's status - in progress, pending review, or complete

4. `activity_selection.csv` can be used to select the recommended activity.   

	- activities have a ranking within each support category (e.g., psychoed is 1). 
	- These rankings are meant to have activities appropriately shuffled and ensure any required psychoed is shown prior to related-activity. 
	- The selection algorithm should also check if the activity has recently been recommended (i.e., from another support category), if it has the activity should be skipped.
