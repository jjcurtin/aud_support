# **1. Urge Surfing Mini-Practice**

**Goal:** Ride the craving wave without acting on it\
**How:** Sit still and notice the craving like a wave:

-   Where do you feel it in your body?

-   What does it feel like (tight, warm, restless)?

-   Remind yourself: *“Waves rise and fall. This will pass.”*

-   

🌊 Most cravings peak and fade within minutes if we don’t fuel them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**2. 5-Senses Grounding**

**Goal:** Distract and anchor yourself in the present\
**How:** Name:

-   5 things you can see

-   4 you can feel

-   3 you can hear

-   2 you can smell

-   1 you can taste

🧠 Pulls your brain out of craving and into now.

**3. Text-a-Friend Prompt**

**Goal:** Interrupt the craving with connection\
**How:** Send one short message to someone in your support network. It can be:

-   “Craving’s hitting me right now—just wanted to say it out loud.”

-   “Hey, can you distract me for a second?”

📱 Cravings feed on isolation. Connection weakens them.

**4. Change the Scene**

**Goal:** Break the craving’s pattern\
**How:** Stand up and physically change locations. Go outside, into another room, or take a short walk—especially if you’re near a trigger (fridge, store, etc.).

🚪Even 60 seconds away from the trigger can help reset your brain.

**5. “Craving = a Message” Reframe**

**Goal:** Understand instead of fear the craving\
**How:** Ask:

-   What is this craving trying to tell me I need right now?

-   Am I tired? Lonely? Bored? Needing comfort or relief?

🔍 Cravings often cover up unmet needs. Once we know the need, we can meet it in a better way.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**6. Delay + Distract Drill**

**Goal:** Create space between the craving and the urge to act\
**How:** Set a timer for just 3 minutes. Do *anything else* until it goes off (walk, stretch, play a quick game, doodle).\
Then reassess: *Do I still want it as much as I did before?*

⏱ Even a short pause can short-circuit the craving loop.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**7. "Play It Through" Visualization**

**Goal:** Interrupt “just one drink” thinking\
**How:** Picture it:

-   What happens if I give in?

-   How will I feel afterward—10 minutes later, tomorrow morning?

Now picture the other path:

-   How will I feel if I ride it out?

🔮 Cravings focus on short-term pleasure. This helps you see the full picture.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**8. Cold Water Reset**

**Goal:** Calm the nervous system and break the craving grip\
**How:** Splash your face with cold water or hold a cold object (ice cube, chilled drink—non-alcoholic!).\
Take 3 deep breaths.

❄️ Physical shock = emotional reset.

**9. Craving Log Quick Note**

**Goal:** Build insight and break the cycle\
**How:** Jot down:

-   What triggered this craving?

-   How intense was it (0–10)?

-   What did I do instead of drinking?

Over time, this log shows you patterns *and* progress.

📓 Writing about it helps shift you from reacting to responding.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**10. Recovery Reminder Card**

**Goal:** Anchor in your *why* during a craving\
**How:** Read or listen to a short note you wrote earlier (or we provide) that reminds you of:

-   Why you started

-   What you’ve already survived

-   What life looks like alcohol-free

💡 In the heat of craving, memory gets foggy. Your card brings clarity back.
