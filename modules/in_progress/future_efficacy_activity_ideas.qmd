### ✅ 1. **“Why I’m Doing This” List**

🔍 *Why?* Reconnecting with your personal reasons for change helps reignite motivation when it feels low.

🧭 **Try This:**

-   

-   Pause for a moment and ask yourself: *Why do I want to stay sober this week?*

-   

-   Now write down or say out loud **3 reasons**—big or small.

    -   

    -   “To feel proud of myself.”

    -   

    -   “So I wake up clear-headed.”

    -   

    -   “Because I deserve better.”

    -   

-   

📝 You just reminded yourself what matters *to you*—and that’s powerful.

### ✅ 2. **Confidence Scaling + Boost**

🔍 *Why?* Even when confidence is low, noticing what’s *working* builds a foundation to grow from.

🧭 **Try This:**

-   

-   On a scale from 0 to 10, how confident do you feel about staying sober this week?

-   

-   Whatever your number is, ask yourself: *Why isn’t it lower?*

    -   

    -   Maybe you’ve made it through before, or you reached out for support.

    -   

-   

-   Now ask: *What’s one small thing I could do to move that number up just one point?*

-   

📈 Tiny shifts in mindset lead to big changes over time.

### ✅ 3. **1-Minute Mental Rehearsal**

🔍 *Why?* Imagining success helps the brain practice it—like a mental “recovery rehearsal.”

🧭 **Try This:**

-   

-   Now imagine yourself getting through it without drinking—calm, steady, and proud.

-

    -   

    -   “This is hard, but I’ve done hard things before.”

    -

    -   

    -   “I’m learning—not failing.”

    -

-   

🗣️ Talk to yourself like you would talk to a friend who’s trying something brave.

🧭 **Try This:**

-   

-   Imagine it’s next week, and you stayed sober.

-   

-   Picture that version of you. How do they feel? What are they proud of? What do they get to enjoy because of your choice today?

-   

-   Now say or write one sentence: *“Future Me will be grateful because…”*

-   

🔮 Motivation flows when we connect with where we’re going—not just where we’ve been.

### ✅ 8. **Ask for Support Challenge**

🔍 *Why?* Asking for help reinforces your commitment and increases follow-through—even if it’s just a text.

🧭 **Try This:**

-   

-   Send a quick message to someone who supports you. It could be:

    -   

    -   “Just letting you know I’m focusing on sobriety this week.”

    -   

    -   “Can I check in with you later if things get tough?”

    -   

-

-   

🤝 Accountability builds both confidence and momentum.

### ✅ 9. **Anchor Phrase Practice**

    -   

    -   “Just for today.”

    -   

    -   “I don’t drink no matter what.”

    -   

    -   “This craving will pass.”

-   

-   Say it out loud now, and again later when you need it.

-   

🔐 Anchor phrases work like emotional life vests—quick, steady reminders of your truth.

### ✅ 10. **Micro Goal Commitment**

🔍 *Why?* Accomplishing small, realistic goals builds self-trust—and that fuels motivation.

🧭 **Try This:**

-   

-   Think of one tiny goal for today. Something that supports your recovery and feels 100% doable.

    -   

    -   “Drink a full glass of water after lunch.”

    -   

    -   “Open the app again tonight.”

    -   

    -   “Write down one reason I want to stay sober.”

    -   

-
