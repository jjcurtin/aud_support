# **üí™ Understanding Motivation in Recovery**

When you are in recovery, there will be times when you feel less motivated or less confident about staying sober. This can happen for many reasons, and it's important to know that it's normal to feel this way sometimes.

**Low motivation** means you might not feel like putting in the effort to stay sober. **Low confidence** means you might not believe that you have the ability to stay sober, even if you want to.

The good news is that both motivation and confidence to keep abstinent can be worked on and improved during recovery. By practicing some simple strategies, you can boost your confidence in your ability to stay sober and get back on track with your recovery.

**1. What is Motivation, Really?**

-   Motivation isn‚Äôt **all or nothing** ‚Äî it‚Äôs **fluid**.

-   It often changes **day-to-day** or even **moment-to-moment**.

-   Feeling unsure or unmotivated doesn‚Äôt mean failure ‚Äî it‚Äôs actually a **normal part of the change process**.

***‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to be 100% motivated to start moving in the right direction.‚Äù***

**2. Why Does Motivation Drop?**

-   You might feel **burned out**, **discouraged**, or just **disconnected** from why you started.

-   Cravings, stress, or life stuff can make alcohol seem like a quick fix again.

-   Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to imagine life without drinking ‚Äî especially if it‚Äôs been a big part of coping, social life, or routine.

-   If you don't see quick results or progress in your recovery, it can sometimes make you feel like it‚Äôs not working, lowering your motivation

-    When we are doing well in our recovery, sometimes our mind tries to trick us into thinking that we can handle a drink or two now. This slippery slope is called "Abstinence drift"

**3. What Actually Helps Motivation?**

Motivation grows when we:

-   **Understand our own reasons** for change (not just what others want for us).

-   **Explore what matters** to us ‚Äî like health, family, freedom, or peace of mind.

-   Feel **heard, not judged** ‚Äî and have support that fits us, not a one-size-fits-all model.

**4. The Change Process Has Stages**

You don‚Äôt have to be ‚Äúready to quit forever‚Äù to start growing. Most people move through these **stages**:

-   **Not yet thinking about change (Precontemplation)**

-   **Thinking about it (Contemplation)**

-   **Preparing to try (Preparation)**

-   **Taking action (Action)**

-   **Working to maintain it (Maintenance)**

Interventions are meant to meet you where you are ‚Äî not push you where you‚Äôre not ready to go.

**5. How to increase motivation and confidence**

-   **Set Small, Achievable Goals**: Instead of focusing on big, overwhelming goals, set smaller, more manageable goals. For example, focus on staying sober for today, or for the next hour.

<!-- -->

-    **Celebrate Your Successes**: Each time you meet a small goal, celebrate it! Recognizing your successes, even the small ones, will boost your motivation and remind you that you can do this.

<!-- -->

-    **Remind Yourself of Your Reasons**: Keep a list of why you want to stay sober. When motivation is low, read through this list to remind yourself why recovery is important to you.

<!-- -->

-    **Visualize Your Success**: Imagine yourself succeeding in your recovery. Picture yourself feeling strong, confident, and sober. This positive mental image can help build your belief in yourself.

<!-- -->

-    **Use Support Networks**: Talk to people who support your recovery. Hearing encouraging words from a friend, sponsor, or counselor can help lift your spirits and boost your motivation.

<!-- -->

-    **Practice Self-Compassion**: If you make a mistake or slip, don‚Äôt be hard on yourself. Be kind and remind yourself that setbacks happen. What matters is getting back on track.

**6. Bottom Line**

-   **It‚Äôs okay to feel unsure.** That‚Äôs a signal to get curious, not give up.

-   Motivation can be **built**, just like a muscle.

-   The goal is progress, not perfection ‚Äî and you don‚Äôt have to do it alone.
