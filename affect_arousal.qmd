## Current feeling

"How are you feeling right now?"

2 questions: 1 unpleasant happy - 11 pleasant/happy and 1 calm/sleepy - 11 aroused/alert

Assumed direction: probably most important if unpleasant/unhappy and calm/sleepy (depressed/low energy) or unplesant/unhappy and high arousal (anxiety)

Can consider if we want to have depressed/low energy map with increasing positive events, separate module that is anxiety? Or one feelings module that provides psychoeducation about role of emotion, cognition, physiology in current experience
