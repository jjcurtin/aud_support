"Since your last survey, has a pleasant or positive event occurred? If yes, rate the intensity of the event. If you experienced more than one pleasant or positive event, rate the most intense one."

Assumed direction: 0 or low (0 - 12) though also potential for pleasant events to increase use

Might want to consider including a likelihood of future positive events?
