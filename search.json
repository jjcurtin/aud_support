For example, if location AA is increasing risk, likely due to them seeking out additional support during time of need. What would this look like in terms of txt? Maybe suggest increased utilization of AA? Is this separate from increased risk broadly?",

    "text": "3 📍 Spending Time in Risky Situations\n\n3.0.1 Spending Time in Risky Places: What It Means for Recovery\nIf you’ve recently spent time in a place that felt risky for your recovery—like a bar, a party, a certain neighborhood, or even someone’s house—you’re not alone. Recovery doesn’t happen in a bubble. Sometimes you end up in places that remind you of drinking or make it harder to stay sober.\nThe good news is: just because you were in a risky place doesn’t mean you’ve failed. What matters most is what you learn from the experience and what you do next.\n\n\n3.0.2 What Makes a Place Risky?\nA risky location is any place that makes it more likely for you to drink or think about drinking. These might include:\n\nBars or liquor stores\nParties or events where people are drinking\nHomes or hangouts where you used to drink\nWorkplaces or social events that feel stressful\nPlaces tied to strong memories of alcohol use\n\nWhat’s risky for one person might not be risky for another. What matters is how you feel when you’re there.\n\n\n3.0.3 Why Does It Matter?\nBeing in risky places can:\n\nTrigger cravings or urges to drink\nBring back old memories or habits\nMake you feel out of place or left out\nLower your guard when it comes to saying “no”\n\nEven if you don’t drink, just being in a risky spot can make staying sober harder. That’s why it’s important to check in with yourself after being in one.\n\n\n3.0.4 Why Do People End Up in Risky Places?\nThere are lots of reasons why you might go to a risky place:\n\nYou didn’t realize it would feel triggering\nYou didn’t want to miss out or disappoint others\nYou thought you could handle it\nYou were caught off guard or didn’t plan ahead\nYou were feeling lonely, bored, or stressed\n\nAgain—this happens. The important part is recognizing it and taking steps to protect your recovery going forward.\n\n\n3.0.5 You Can Learn from the Experience\nSpending time in a risky place doesn’t undo your recovery. It’s a chance to learn more about your triggers and prepare better for the future.\nAsk yourself:\n\nWhat made this place feel risky for me?\nHow did I feel while I was there?\nWhat might I do differently next time?\n\nBeing honest about your experience helps you grow stronger and stay in control of your recovery.\n\n\n3.0.6 You’re Still in Charge\nJust because you were in a risky place doesn’t mean you have to stay there—or go back. You’re in control of your choices. You can:\n\nDecide not to return to that place\nMake a plan to bring support with you next time\nSet boundaries for where you go and for how long\nFocus on people and places that support your recovery\n\nRecovery is about making decisions that protect your well-being—one step, one choice at a time.\n\n\n3.0.7 Moving Forward from Here\nThe following tools and exercises can help you:\n\nReflect on what made the location feel risky\nStrengthen your boundaries\nBuild a plan for how to handle similar situations in the future\nRemind yourself why you’re committed to staying sober\n\nBeing in a risky place doesn’t mean you’ve failed—it’s a sign you’re learning, growing, and doing the hard work of recovery. You’ve got this.",

A craving is when you feel the strong urge to drink, even though you don’t want to. This can show up as thoughts, emotions, or physical sensations that pull you toward drinking, even if part of you wants to stay sober.\nGood news: Cravings are short-lived, predictable, and controllable. With practice, they will get weaker, and you’ll feel more confident in handling them when they pop up.",

It’s a sign that recovery is still in progress—and that’s okay.\n\n\n6.0.2 Slips Happen in Recovery\nA slip is when someone who is trying to stop drinking has a drink after a period of being sober. It can be one drink, or it can last longer. A slip does not mean you can’t stay sober—it means there’s more to learn about what makes you want to drink and how to handle those moments. Slips are a COMMON, NORMAL part of recovery and can actually serve as powerful learning moments if you explore them without judgment\n\n\n6.0.3 Why Do Slips Happen?\nSlips can happen for many reasons, such as:\n\nStress: When life feels overwhelming or too hard\nStrong cravings: When urges to drink feel too powerful to ignore\nEmotions: Feeling lonely, sad, angry, or even too happy\nTriggers: Being in a place, around certain people, or in a situation where you used to drink\nLow confidence: Thinking “I can’t do this,” or “It’s just one drink, it won’t matter”\n\nKnowing what led to the slip can help you avoid it in the future.\n\n\n6.0.4 What Can You Do After a Slip?\nWhat you do after a slip is what really matters. You don’t have to wait until next week, next month, or after “one last drink” to get back on track. You can restart right now. Some helpful actions after slips are:\n\nBe honest with yourself – Don’t pretend it didn’t happen. Admitting it helps you move forward.\nLet go of shame – You made a mistake, but you’re not a failure. Everyone makes mistakes.\nFigure out what led to the slip – Think about the situation, thoughts, or feelings that came before it.\nMake a plan for next time – Decide what you’ll do differently if a similar situation comes up again.\nReach out – Talk to someone who supports your recovery. You don’t have to go through this alone.\n\n\n\n6.0.5 What You Tell Yourself Matters\nAfter a slip, it’s easy to think:\n\n“I blew it.”\n“I have to start all over.”\n“I’ll never be able to stay sober.”\n\nBut these thoughts are not true—and they’re not helpful. Instead, try thinking:\n\n“I had a setback, but I’m still moving forward.”\n“I can learn from this.”\n“I’m still in recovery, and I’m not giving up.”\n\n\n\n6.0.6 A Slip Doesn’t Erase Your Progress\nAll the work you’ve done so far still counts. One slip doesn’t erase your growth, your effort, or your reasons for wanting to stay sober. You’ve already taken steps toward change—and those steps still matter.\nRecovery isn’t about being perfect. It’s about getting back up when things get hard. Every time you do that, you build strength.\n\n\n6.0.7 You Can Start Again—Right Now\nYou don’t have to wait for a perfect moment. You can restart right now, in this moment. Take a deep breath, and take the next small step.\nThe tools and exercises that follow are here to help you:\n\nUnderstand what happened\nReconnect to your recovery goals\nStrengthen your plan for staying sober\n\nYou’re not starting over. You’re continuing your journey—stronger, wiser, and more prepared than before.",

    "text": "6.1 🔹 Brief Self-Guided Interventions for Expected Future Stressful Events\n\n6.1.1 ✅ 1. Pre-Emptive Stress Coping Plan\n🔍 Why? Stress is inevitable, but having a plan makes it easier to navigate without alcohol.\n🧭 Try This:\n\n\nThink about an upcoming stressful event you anticipate this week.\n\nWrite down or say aloud 2–3 ways you can handle the stress without alcohol.\n\n\n“I’ll take a break to breathe when I feel overwhelmed.”\n\n“I’ll call a friend or family member to talk it through.”\n\n\n\n\n💡 You’ve already got the tools to handle stress—now, put them into action.\n\n\n6.1.2 ✅ 2. Stress Reduction Breathing\n🔍 Why? Deep breathing helps lower stress in the moment and creates space to choose better responses.\n🧭 Try This:\n\n\nClose your eyes and take a deep breath in for a count of 4.\n\nHold your breath for a count of 4.\n\nExhale slowly for a count of 4.\n\nRepeat this 3 times.\n\n\n🌬️ Just a few deep breaths can make a big difference.\n\n\n6.1.3 ✅ 3. Mindful Moment: Stress Detour\n🔍 Why? Mindfulness helps break the cycle of stress and reactiveness.\n🧭 Try This:\n\n\nFor the next 60 seconds, fully immerse yourself in what’s around you.\n\n\nFeel your feet on the ground.\n\nListen to the sounds in the room or outside.\n\nNotice how your body feels right now, without judgment.\n\n\n\nAfterward, take a moment to ask yourself: “What’s the next step I can take to stay on course today?”\n\n\n🌱 You can be mindful during stress, not just after it.\n\n\n6.1.4 ✅ 4. Stress-Free Zone Visualization\n🔍 Why? Visualization helps you prepare for future stressors by picturing yourself handling them calmly.\n🧭 Try This:\n\n\nClose your eyes and visualize a peaceful place—whether it’s a quiet room, a beautiful outdoor space, or somewhere you feel completely relaxed.\n\nImagine yourself there, calm and in control, as you navigate the upcoming stressor.\n\nRepeat the phrase: “I can handle whatever comes.”\n\n\n🧘‍♀️ Mental preparation makes future stressors more manageable.\n\n\n6.1.5 ✅ 5. “Just For Today” Focus\n🔍 Why?

That’s all you need to focus on right now.",

    "text": "8 🌊 Understanding Cravings\nAs you work on changing your drinking, it’s normal to have urges or cravings for alcohol. A craving is when you feel the strong urge to drink, even though you don’t want to. This can show up as thoughts, emotions, or physical sensations that pull you toward drinking, even if part of you wants to stay sober.\nGood news: Cravings are short-lived, predictable, and controllable. With practice, they will get weaker, and you’ll feel more confident in handling them when they pop up.\n\n8.0.1 What is a Craving?\nA craving is a powerful feeling that pushes you to drink alcohol, even when you don’t want to. It can feel like a strong mental or physical need to drink. Cravings happen because of the long-term use of alcohol, and they can last for some time after you stop drinking.\nIf you’ve had a lot of drinking in the past, cravings may come up more often or feel stronger. But don’t worry! Cravings are a normal part of recovery, and they happen at all stages of recovery.\n\n\n8.0.2 How Do Cravings Show Up?\nCravings can look different for everyone. Here are some ways cravings might show up for you:\n\nPhysical feelings: You might feel shaky, sweaty, or have a racing heart.\nThoughts: You might think, “I want a drink,” or “It would be fun to drink with my friends right now.”\nEmotions: Cravings can come with feelings like anxiety, frustration, or sadness.\nBehaviors: You might find yourself lingering near places where alcohol is sold, or spending time with others who are drinking.\n\n\n\n8.0.3 Cravings Are Predictable\nCravings don’t happen randomly. They can be triggered by certain situations or emotions. These triggers can be internal (how you’re feeling) or external (things around you).\n\nInternal triggers: These are feelings or thoughts that can bring on cravings, like stress, sadness, or even excitement. You might also feel physical discomfort, like being tired or in pain.\nExternal triggers: These are things in the environment that remind you of drinking, like seeing alcohol, being around people who drink, or even times of day when you used to drink.\n\nThe more you recognize what causes your cravings, the better you can plan for them. Understanding what triggers your cravings can help you avoid or manage them.\n\n\n8.0.4 Cravings Are Temporary\nCravings might feel intense, but here’s the important thing to remember: they don’t last long. Most cravings only last a few minutes. Think of a craving like a wave in the ocean. It starts small, gets bigger, and then crashes and disappears.\nEven though cravings can feel overwhelming at first, they are time-limited and will pass. The key is not giving in to the craving. The more you ignore the craving and choose not to drink, the weaker it becomes.\n\n\n8.0.5 Cravings Get Easier Over Time\nAt the start of your recovery, cravings may be stronger and more frequent. But over time, they will get weaker and less intense. Each time you resist the urge to drink, the craving loses power.\nStopping alcohol use completely is the fastest way to get rid of cravings. If you don’t reward craving with alcohol use, it will eventually go away. It’s like feeding a stray animal. If you stop feeding it, it will stop coming back.\n\n\n8.0.6 What Can You Do When a Craving Hits?\nWhen you feel a craving, remember: it’s temporary and you can control how you respond. Here are some ways to deal with cravings:\n\nPause and Breathe: Take a deep breath. Focus on the present moment.\nDistraction: Do something else to take your mind off the craving, like going for a walk, calling a friend, or reading a book.\nUrge Surfing: Imagine the craving is like a wave—let it build, but know it will crash and pass.\nReach Out: Talk to someone you trust, like a sponsor or a friend. Sometimes, just sharing how you feel can help.\n\n\n\n\n8.0.7 Remember: Cravings Don’t Last Forever\nIt’s completely normal to experience cravings in recovery. But the more you practice coping with them, the easier it will get. Cravings are like visitors—they come and go. With time and practice, you will get better at handling them.\nBy staying sober, even when cravings are strong, you’ll find that the cravings become less powerful and easier to ignore. You’ve got this!",

    "text": "9 1. Urge Surfing Mini-Practice\nGoal: Ride the craving wave without acting on it\nHow: Sit still and notice the craving like a wave:\n\nWhere do you feel it in your body?\nWhat does it feel like (tight, warm, restless)?\nRemind yourself: “Waves rise and fall. This will pass.”\n\n\n🌊 Most cravings peak and fade within minutes if we don’t fuel them.\n\n2. 5-Senses Grounding\nGoal: Distract and anchor yourself in the present\nHow: Name:\n\n5 things you can see\n4 you can feel\n3 you can hear\n2 you can smell\n1 you can taste\n\n🧠 Pulls your brain out of craving and into now.\n3. Text-a-Friend Prompt\nGoal: Interrupt the craving with connection\nHow: Send one short message to someone in your support network. It can be:\n\n“Craving’s hitting me right now—just wanted to say it out loud.”\n“Hey, can you distract me for a second?”\n\n📱 Cravings feed on isolation. Connection weakens them.\n4. Change the Scene\nGoal: Break the craving’s pattern\nHow: Stand up and physically change locations. Go outside, into another room, or take a short walk—especially if you’re near a trigger (fridge, store, etc.).\n🚪Even 60 seconds away from the trigger can help reset your brain.\n5. “Craving = a Message” Reframe\nGoal: Understand instead of fear the craving\nHow: Ask:\n\nWhat is this craving trying to tell me I need right now?\nAm I tired? Lonely? Bored? Needing comfort or relief?\n\n🔍 Cravings often cover up unmet needs. Once we know the need, we can meet it in a better way.\n\n6. Delay + Distract Drill\nGoal: Create space between the craving and the urge to act\nHow: Set a timer for just 3 minutes. Do anything else until it goes off (walk, stretch, play a quick game, doodle).\nThen reassess: Do I still want it as much as I did before?\n⏱ Even a short pause can short-circuit the craving loop.\n\n7. “Play It Through” Visualization\nGoal: Interrupt “just one drink” thinking\nHow: Picture it:\n\nWhat happens if I give in?\nHow will I feel afterward—10 minutes later, tomorrow morning?\n\nNow picture the other path:\n\nHow will I feel if I ride it out?\n\n🔮 Cravings focus on short-term pleasure. This helps you see the full picture.\n\n8. Cold Water Reset\nGoal: Calm the nervous system and break the craving grip\nHow: Splash your face with cold water or hold a cold object (ice cube, chilled drink—non-alcoholic!).\nTake 3 deep breaths.\n❄️ Physical shock = emotional reset.\n9. Craving Log Quick Note\nGoal: Build insight and break the cycle\nHow: Jot down:\n\nWhat triggered this craving?\nHow intense was it (0–10)?\nWhat did I do instead of drinking?\n\nOver time, this log shows you patterns and progress.\n📓 Writing about it helps shift you from reacting to responding.\n\n10. Recovery Reminder Card\nGoal: Anchor in your why during a craving\nHow: Read or listen to a short note you wrote earlier (or we provide) that reminds you of:\n\nWhy you started\nWhat you’ve already survived\nWhat life looks like alcohol-free\n\n💡 In the heat of craving, memory gets foggy. Your card brings clarity back.\nOTHER FORMATTING OPTION:::\n\n9.0.1 1. Urge Surfing Mini-Practice\n\n“You’re having a craving right now—and that’s okay. Let’s take a moment to surf this urge instead of fighting it.\nClose your eyes or soften your gaze. Now, notice where you feel the craving in your body. Is it in your chest? Your stomach? Your jaw? Just observe, without judging.\nLike a wave, the craving will rise… peak… and fade. You don’t have to do anything—just stay with it. You’re riding it out, not giving in. Keep breathing. You’re doing great.\nThis will pass. It always does.”\n\n\n\n9.0.2 2. 5-Senses Grounding\n\n“Let’s bring you back to the here and now. Just follow along with your senses:\n\n\nName 5 things you can see.\n\nNow, 4 things you can feel—like your clothes, the floor, or your breath.\n\n3 things you can hear, even very faint sounds.\n\n2 things you can smell.\n\nAnd finally, 1 thing you can taste—or imagine tasting.\n\n\nTake a deep breath. You’re grounded. You’re in control. The craving doesn’t run the show—you do.”\n\n\n\n9.0.3 3. Text-a-Friend Prompt\n\n“Cravings love silence. Connection takes away their power.\nOpen your messages and send a quick text to someone who supports you. It could be as simple as:\n‘Hey, craving’s hitting me. Just needed to say it out loud.’\nOr: ‘I’m staying sober today, but it’s hard right now. Can you check in with me later?’\nYou don’t have to go through this alone. Reaching out is strength—not weakness.”\n\n\n\n9.0.4 4. Change the Scene\n\n“Sometimes, the quickest way to shift a craving is to shift your space.\nIf you can, stand up right now and walk into another room. Step outside. Open a window. Move your body for a minute.\nEven a short change of scenery tells your brain: this moment is changing. You’re taking back control.\nEvery step you take away from the craving is a step toward your goals.”\n\n\n\n9.0.5 5. Craving = A Message Reframe\n\n“What if this craving isn’t a threat—but a signal?\nAsk yourself gently: What do I really need right now?\nAm I tired? Hungry? Lonely? Sad? Just bored?\nYour craving might be trying to tell you something—something you can actually take care of without drinking.\nListen to the message… and take a small step to meet the real need underneath.”\n\n\n\n9.0.6 6. Delay + Distract Drill\n\n“You don’t have to say ‘no’ forever—just for the next few minutes.\nSet a mental timer for 3 minutes. While we wait, do anything else: walk around, count your breaths, scroll through photos that make you smile—anything.\nWhen the time’s up, ask yourself: Do I still want it as much?\nYou’ve just proven that you can pause a craving. And if you can pause it… you can outlast it.”\n\n\n\n9.0.7 7. Play It Through Visualization\n\n“Cravings love to whisper, ‘Just one won’t hurt.’ So let’s play it through.\nClose your eyes for a moment. Imagine giving in. What happens next? How do you feel 10 minutes later? What about tomorrow morning?\nNow, picture staying sober instead. Getting through it. Waking up clear-headed. Feeling proud.\nOne choice leads to regret. The other leads to freedom. You know which path is yours.”\n\n\n\n9.0.8 8. Cold Water Reset\n\n“Let’s hit the reset button—physically.\nGrab something cold. Splash water on your face or hold something chilled. Feel that shock? That’s your nervous system getting a jolt of calm.\nNow take 3 slow, deep breaths.\nSometimes your body just needs a signal that things are okay. This is that signal. You’ve got this.”\n\n\n\n9.0.9 9. Craving Log Quick Note\n\n“Let’s turn this craving into knowledge you can use.\nTake a few seconds to note: What triggered this craving? How intense was it, from 0 to 10? What did you do instead of drinking?\nEach craving you log helps you see your progress and understand your patterns. This isn’t just a craving—it’s a clue. And you’re learning how to outsmart it.”\n\n\n\n9.0.10 10. Recovery Reminder Card\n\n“Take a deep breath. This is your reminder:\nYou’ve come so far already. You’re doing this for a reason—and that reason still matters, even when it’s hard.\nPicture yourself one week from now, looking back at this moment. What will you be proud of?\nYou don’t need to be perfect. You just need to keep going. You’re strong. You’re not alone. And you’re doing something that matters.”",

    "text": "10 💪 Understanding Motivation in Recovery\nWhen you are in recovery, there will be times when you feel less motivated or less confident about staying sober. This can happen for many reasons, and it’s important to know that it’s normal to feel this way sometimes.\nLow motivation means you might not feel like putting in the effort to stay sober. Low confidence means you might not believe that you have the ability to stay sober, even if you want to.\nThe good news is that both motivation and confidence to keep abstinent can be worked on and improved during recovery. By practicing some simple strategies, you can boost your confidence in your ability to stay sober and get back on track with your recovery.\n1. What is Motivation, Really?\n\nMotivation isn’t all or nothing — it’s fluid.\nIt often changes day-to-day or even moment-to-moment.\nFeeling unsure or unmotivated doesn’t mean failure — it’s actually a normal part of the change process.\n\n“You don’t need to be 100% motivated to start moving in the right direction.”\n2. Why Does Motivation Drop?\n\nYou might feel burned out, discouraged, or just disconnected from why you started.\nCravings, stress, or life stuff can make alcohol seem like a quick fix again.\nSometimes it’s hard to imagine life without drinking — especially if it’s been a big part of coping, social life, or routine.\nIf you don’t see quick results or progress in your recovery, it can sometimes make you feel like it’s not working, lowering your motivation\nWhen we are doing well in our recovery, sometimes our mind tries to trick us into thinking that we can handle a drink or two now. This slippery slope is called “Abstinence drift”\n\n3. What Actually Helps Motivation?\nMotivation grows when we:\n\nUnderstand our own reasons for change (not just what others want for us).\nExplore what matters to us — like health, family, freedom, or peace of mind.\nFeel heard, not judged — and have support that fits us, not a one-size-fits-all model.\n\n4. The Change Process Has Stages\nYou don’t have to be “ready to quit forever” to start growing. Most people move through these stages:\n\nNot yet thinking about change (Precontemplation)\nThinking about it (Contemplation)\nPreparing to try (Preparation)\nTaking action (Action)\nWorking to maintain it (Maintenance)\n\nInterventions are meant to meet you where you are — not push you where you’re not ready to go.\n5. How to increase motivation and confidence\n\nSet Small, Achievable Goals: Instead of focusing on big, overwhelming goals, set smaller, more manageable goals. For example, focus on staying sober for today, or for the next hour.\n\n\n\nCelebrate Your Successes: Each time you meet a small goal, celebrate it! Recognizing your successes, even the small ones, will boost your motivation and remind you that you can do this.\n\n\n\nRemind Yourself of Your Reasons: Keep a list of why you want to stay sober. When motivation is low, read through this list to remind yourself why recovery is important to you.\n\n\n\nVisualize Your Success: Imagine yourself succeeding in your recovery. Picture yourself feeling strong, confident, and sober. This positive mental image can help build your belief in yourself.\n\n\n\nUse Support Networks: Talk to people who support your recovery. Hearing encouraging words from a friend, sponsor, or counselor can help lift your spirits and boost your motivation.\n\n\n\nPractice Self-Compassion: If you make a mistake or slip, don’t be hard on yourself. Be kind and remind yourself that setbacks happen. What matters is getting back on track.\n\n6. Bottom Line\n\nIt’s okay to feel unsure. That’s a signal to get curious, not give up.\nMotivation can be built, just like a muscle.\nThe goal is progress, not perfection — and you don’t have to do it alone.",

Past Success Reflection\n🔍 Why?

Ask for Support Challenge\n🔍 Why? Asking for help reinforces your commitment and increases follow-through—even if it’s just a text.\n🧭 Try This:\n\n\nSend a quick message to someone who supports you. It could be:\n\n\n“Just letting you know I’m focusing on sobriety this week.”\n\n“Can I check in with you later if things get tough?”\n\n\n\nDon’t overthink it. One sentence is enough.\n\n\n🤝 Accountability builds both confidence and momentum.\n\n\n11.0.9 ✅ 9. Anchor Phrase Practice\n🔍 Why? Having a go-to phrase in hard moments keeps you centered and focused.\n🧭 Try This:\n\n\nChoose one short phrase to repeat when your motivation wobbles:\n\n\n“Just for today.”\n\n“I don’t drink no matter what.”\n\n“This craving will pass.”\n\n\n\nSay it out loud now, and again later when you need it.\n\n\n🔐 Anchor phrases work like emotional life vests—quick, steady reminders of your truth.\n\n\n11.0.10 ✅ 10. Micro Goal Commitment\n🔍 Why? Accomplishing small, realistic goals builds self-trust—and that fuels motivation.\n🧭 Try This:\n\n\nThink of one tiny goal for today. Something that supports your recovery and feels 100% doable.\n\n\n“Drink a full glass of water after lunch.”\n\n“Open the app again tonight.”\n\n“Write down one reason I want to stay sober.”\n\n\n\nSay it out loud or text it to yourself.\n\n\n🎯 Showing up for even one small promise to yourself builds momentum.",

Recovery doesn’t happen in a bubble. Sometimes you end up in places that remind you of drinking or make it harder to stay sober.\nThe good news is: just because you were in a risky place doesn’t mean you’ve failed. What matters most is what you learn from the experience and what you do next.\n\n\n12.0.2 What Makes a Place Risky?\nA risky location is any place that makes it more likely for you to drink or think about drinking. These might include:\n\nBars or liquor stores\nParties or events where people are drinking\nHomes or hangouts where you used to drink\nWorkplaces or social events that feel stressful\nPlaces tied to strong memories of alcohol use\n\nWhat’s risky for one person might not be risky for another. What matters is how you feel when you’re there.\n\n\n12.0.3 Why Does It Matter?\nBeing in risky places can:\n\nTrigger cravings or urges to drink\nBring back old memories or habits\nMake you feel out of place or left out\nLower your guard when it comes to saying “no”\n\nEven if you don’t drink, just being in a risky spot can make staying sober harder. That’s why it’s important to check in with yourself after being in one.\n\n\n12.0.4 Why Do People End Up in Risky Places?\nThere are lots of reasons why you might go to a risky place:\n\nYou didn’t realize it would feel triggering\nYou didn’t want to miss out or disappoint others\nYou thought you could handle it\nYou were caught off guard or didn’t plan ahead\nYou were feeling lonely, bored, or stressed\n\nAgain—this happens. The important part is recognizing it and taking steps to protect your recovery going forward.\n\n\n12.0.5 You Can Learn from the Experience\nSpending time in a risky place doesn’t undo your recovery. It’s a chance to learn more about your triggers and prepare better for the future.\nAsk yourself:\n\nWhat made this place feel risky for me?\nHow did I feel while I was there?\nWhat might I do differently next time?\n\nBeing honest about your experience helps you grow stronger and stay in control of your recovery.\n\n\n12.0.6 You’re Still in Charge\nJust because you were in a risky place doesn’t mean you have to stay there—or go back. You’re in control of your choices. You can:\n\nDecide not to return to that place\nMake a plan to bring support with you next time\nSet boundaries for where you go and for how long\nFocus on people and places that support your recovery\n\nRecovery is about making decisions that protect your well-being—one step, one choice at a time.\n\n\n12.0.7 Moving Forward from Here\nThe following tools and exercises can help you:\n\nReflect on what made the location feel risky\nStrengthen your boundaries\nBuild a plan for how to handle similar situations in the future\nRemind yourself why you’re committed to staying sober\n\nBeing in a risky place doesn’t mean you’ve failed—it’s a sign you’re learning, growing, and doing the hard work of recovery. You’ve got this.",
