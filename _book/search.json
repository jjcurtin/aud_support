The words “urge” and “craving” refer to a broad range of thoughts, physical sensations, or emotions that tempt you to drink, even though you have at least some desire not to. You may feel an uncomfortable pull in two directions or sense a loss of control.\nFortunately, urges to drink are short-lived, predictable, and controllable. With time, and by practicing new responses, you’ll find that your urges to drink will lose strength, and you’ll gain confidence in your ability to deal with urges that may still arise at times.\nHere are some important facts about craving to keep in mind as you begin to work with identifying and coping with urges during recovery:",

Cravings are the result of long-term alcohol and/or other drug use and can continue for some time after the use has stopped. People with a history of heavier use might experience stronger or more frequent urges. Experiencing cravings is a normal part of recovery and is common across all stages of recovery.\nCravings and urges can show up in many ways, such as:\n\nPhysical sensations (e.g., sweating, heart racing, queasy stomach)\nThoughts (e.g., “A drink sounds good right now”, “I’d rather be with my friends getting drunk tonight”)\nPositive expectancies (e.g., “I would have more fun if I was drinking”)\nEmotions (e.g., anxiety, depression, irritability)\nBehaviors (e.g., pausing while passing the beer display in a store, hanging out in bars or with others who are drinking).",

Without it, the brain makes chemical demands and requests for alcohol. You can expect cravings from withdrawal to be present at the beginning of recovery and diminish over time\nTriggers have to do with our memories of alcohol. Alcohol and other drugs flood our brain with reward chemicals like dopamine. Long after our last drink, our brains and memories still associate drinking with this flood of reward. When we’re exposed to a cue or stimulus that triggers those latent memories, our brains beg us for more reward chemicals. And thus a craving is born.\nCravings can be internal or external:\nInternal Situations:\n\nUnpleasant emotions (e.g., frustration, depression, anger, feeling “stressed out”)\nPleasant emotions (e.g., joy, excitement)\nPhysical feelings (e.g., sick, shaky, tense, in pain)\nThoughts about drinking (e.g., “I’ll feel better if I get drink”)\n\nExternal Situations\n\nExposure to alcohol (e.g. alcohol in the home)\nSmell, sight and sounds of other people drinking\nParticular times during the day when drinking used to occur (e.g., getting off work, weekends, payday)\nStimuli previously associated with drinking (e.g., wine glasses, bar, , ATM machine)\nStimuli previously associated with withdrawal (e.g., hospital, aspirin, morning)\n\nThe more we learn to better identify our cravings, the better we can predict them",

Most cravings last only a few minutes.\nA craving is just like a wave at the beach. Every wave in a set starts off small, builds up to its highest point, and then breaks and flows away to shore. Each individual wave never lasts more than a few minutes. A craving is just the same. It starts off small and then builds up. But it peaks, just like a wave, and will eventually break and disappear. This whole process usually doesn’t last more than minutes. Cravings are time-limited.\nCravings will lose their power if they are not reinforced by using or drinking in response. Even if use occurs only once in a while, it will still keep those cravings alive. Cravings are like stray animals – keep feeding them and they will keep coming back. So in a very real sense these cravings are controllable.\nCravings tend to be stronger earlier on, then weaken, and eventually fade over time.\nEach time a person does something other than drink and/or use others drugs, the craving loses power.\nStopping alcohol and other drug use completely is the quickest way to get rid of the cravings.",

    "text": "5 Abstinence goal\n“Is your goal still to remain abstinent in the future?”\nAssumed direction: No or Uncertain\nLanding page - Patterns of motivation in AUD treatment, importance of maintaining motivation\nFrom MATRIX\nHave you been able to stop using alcohol completely? At about 6 weeks into the recovery process, many people return to alcohol use. Has your addicted brain played with the idea? These are some of the most common arguments against stopping the use of alcohol and answers to the arguments. I came here to stop using speed, not to stop drinking. Part of stopping methamphetamine use is stopping all substance use, including alcohol use. I’ve had drinks and not used, so it doesn’t make any difference. Drinking over time greatly increases the risk of relapse. A single drink does not necessarily cause relapse any more than a single cigarette causes lung cancer. However, with continued drinking, the risks of relapse greatly increase. Drinking actually helps. When I have a craving, a drink calms me down, and the craving goes away. Alcohol interferes with the brain’s chemical healing process. Continued alcohol use eventually intensifies cravings, even if one drink seems to reduce cravings. I’m not an alcoholic, so why do I need to stop drinking? If you’re not an alcoholic, you should have no problem stopping alcohol use. If you can’t stop, maybe alcohol is more of a problem than you realize. I’m never going to use drugs again, but I’m not sure I’ll never drink again. Make a 6-month commitment to total abstinence. Give yourself the chance to make a decision about alcohol with a drug-free brain. If you reject alcohol abstinence because “forever” scares you, then you’re justifying drinking now and risking relapse to substance use.\nMotivation for recovery\n“Fear will get people into treatment, but fear alone is not enough to keep them in recovery”\nAsk any group of people who are new to recovery why they want to stop using right now and you will get many different answers: ● I was arrested, and it’s either this or jail. ● My wife says if I don’t stop, we are finished. ● Last time I used I thought I was going to die; I know I’ll die if I use again. ● They are going to take the children from us unless we stop. ● I’ve been using for 20 years now; it’s time to change. Which of the people quoted is most likely to be successful in recovery? It seems logical to think that people who want to stop using for themselves and not because someone else wants them to are more likely to do well in treatment. However, that may not be true. Research shows that the reasons people stop using don’t predict whether they will be able to lead substance-free lives. What does make a difference is whether they can stay substance free long enough to appreciate the benefits of a different lifestyle. When debts are not overwhelming, relationships are rewarding, work is going well, and health is good, the person in recovery wants to stay abstinent.\nRelapse justification\nOnce a person decides not to use drugs anymore, how does that person end up using again? Do relapses happen completely by accident? Or are there warning signs and ways to avoid relapse? Relapse justification is a process that happens in people’s minds. A person may have decided to stop using, but the person’s brain is still healing and still feels the need for the substances. The addicted brain invents excuses that allow the person in recovery to edge close enough to relapse situations that accidents can happen. You may remember a time when you intended to stay drug free but you invented a justification for using, and before you knew it, you had used again. Understanding and anticipating the justifications help you interrupt the process. Use the questions below to help you identify justifications you might be susceptible to. Substance Dependence Is Cured Has your addicted brain ever convinced you that you could use just once or use just a little? For example, have you said any of the following? ● I’m back in control. I’ll be able to stop when I want to. ● I’ve learned my lesson. I’ll only use small amounts and only once in a while. ● This substance was not my problem—stimulants were. So I can use this and not relapse. ● Other: ______________________________________________\nTesting Yourself It’s very easy to forget that being smart, not being strong, is the key to staying abstinent. Have you ever wanted to prove you could be stronger than drugs? For example, have you said any of the following? ● I’m strong enough to be around it now. ● I want to see whether I can say “No” to drinking and using. ● I want to see whether I can be around my old friends. ● I want to see how the high feels now that I’ve stopped using. ● Other: ______________________________________________ Celebrating You may be encouraged by other people or your addicted brain to make an exception to your abstinence. Have you ever tried to justify using with the following thoughts? ● I’m feeling really good. One time won’t hurt. ● I’m on vacation. I’ll go back to not using when I get home. ● I’m doing so well. Things are going great. I owe myself a reward. ● This is such a special event that I want to celebrate. ● Other: ______________________________________________ What might you do when confronted with these excuses to use?",

People who experience mental wellness can cope with stress and make better decisions; whereas, mental illness or poor mental health can lead to problems with thinking, mood, and behavior.2\nPoor mental health and addiction are mutually reinforcing—that is to say, when you feel bad, you may feel more inclined to misuse substances. Research has shown that emotional dysregulation (meaning an inability to control your responses to stimuli) can not only be a risk factor for addiction, alcohol use disorder, and depression, but also cause increased emotional problems. In addition, long-term drug use can impair your ability to deal with intense emotions and cause further emotional dysregulation.3\nResearch has also shown that alcohol, drugs, and mental health disorders are strongly intertwined. Disorders and behaviors such as depression, aggressiveness, and anger are correlated with a higher likelihood of substance and alcohol misuse.4 A recent study found that alcohol and depression are closely linked, with sadness being a strong predictor of addiction.5",

    "text": "3.4 Exploring The Relationship Between Depression and Addiction\nEveryone feels blue or down from time to time, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that they have depression. Depression is a serious mental health condition that requires medical care because it can worsen if left untreated.6\nDepression occurs when you experience obvious negative changes in mood, thought processes, and motivation that last for at least two weeks and affect your ability to function.7 There are different types of depressive disorders, including major depression, postpartum depression, bipolar disorder, and seasonal affective disorder.8\nMajor depressive disorder is a clinical disorder that involves experiencing symptoms of depressed mood and loss of interest for at least 2 weeks.9 The signs and symptoms of depression include:8\n\nAppetite and sleep changes.\nFatigue or low energy.\nFeeling chronically sad, empty, or anxious.\nFeeling guilty, worthless, or helpless.\nFeeling hopeless or pessimistic.\nFeelings of restlessness.\nHaving trouble concentrating or remembering things.\nIrritability.\nLoss of interest in activities you once enjoyed.\nThoughts of suicide or self-harm.\nUnexplained aches and pains.\nDepression and substance misuse or alcohol use disorder often co-occur, but the exact biological reasons for this are not entirely clear.10 People make choices for different reasons, so the reasons why one person becomes addicted and another doesn’t can vary. Regardless, studies confirm the link between substance misuse and depression; furthermore, depressed people may be more inclined to misuse alcohol.10 Depression symptoms may subside when people stop drinking, but finding the motivation to enter treatment can be difficult.11\nDifferent types of depression may lead to an increased risk of substance misuse, although clinical studies have demonstrated mixed results.9 In particular, people with major depression are twice as likely to have a substance use disorder than people without a mood disorder, and people with bipolar disorder are 7 times more likely to suffer from addiction.9 One study of lifetime prevalence rates showed that, among people who were diagnosed with a mood disorder, 32% had a co-occurring substance use disorder (SUD). Among those who had major depression, 16.5% had an alcohol use disorder and 18% had a drug use disorder; out of those who had bipolar disorder, 56% had a lifetime SUD.9\nIn addition to underlying genetic factors, depression and addiction may be so closely related because many people self-medicate with drugs or alcohol as a way of managing their depressive symptoms.9 However, instead of making things better, it often only exacerbates the issue, and depression and alcohol use can both spiral out of control.9\nSomeone who experiences depression and addiction displays symptoms of depression as well as addiction, the combination of which is known as a co-occurring disorder. Additionally, people with co-occurring disorders are at higher risk of suicide attempts.11 Luckily, symptoms of depression and symptoms of addiction can both be effectively addressed in rehab.12",

    "text": "3.5 Exploring The Relationship Between Addiction & Anger\nAnger is a human emotion that can occur in response to discomfort and is seen as a predictor of aggressive behavior. People with high levels of aggression often display more verbal and physical aggression toward other people and may have higher risks of mental illness.13\nDifferent types of anger can affect you in different ways and cause various signs and symptoms. Some clinicians believe that there are 3 main types of anger, including:14\n\nPassive aggression, which means you feel angry but act out your anger in passive ways because you fear confrontation, such as giving people the silent treatment or saying everything is fine when it’s not.\nOpen aggression, which stems from a need to feel in control. In this form of anger, you may lash out because of feelings of rage and become physically or verbally violent and aggressive. You might engage in bullying, yelling, blackmailing, or criticizing others.\nAssertive anger, which is thought to be the healthiest form of anger. You act maturely and respectfully toward others, talk about your feelings, and listen to others instead of acting out.\n\nAnger and substance misuse are strongly correlated. One study of incarcerated adolescents showed that outwardly expressed anger was significantly related to marijuana and alcohol use.15 Another study showed that 40% of cocaine users suffered from different levels of aggression.13",

    "text": "3.1.1 Can You Recognize Your Feelings?\nSometimes people don’t allow themselves to have certain emotions (for example, you tell yourself, “Feeling angry is not all right”). Sometimes people aren’t honest with themselves about their emotions (for example, saying, “I’m just having a bad day,” when the truth is they’re sad). When you mislabel emotions or deny them, you cannot address them and they build up inside you.\n\n\n3.1.2 Are You Aware of Physical Signs of Certain Feelings?\nMaybe you get an upset stomach when you are anxious, bite your fingernails when you are stressed, or shake when you are angry. Think about the emotions that trouble you, and try to identify how they show physically.\n\n\n3.1.3 How Do You Cope With Your Feelings Now?\nHow do you respond when you experience negative emotions? How do your feelings affect you and others around you? For instance, do your feelings interfere with your relationships with others? Do people avoid you, try to keep you from getting upset, or try to make you feel better? Focus on one or two emotions you need to cope with better.\n\n\n3.1.4 How Do You Express Your Emotions?\nIt is important to find an appropriate way to express emotions. You can express feelings indirectly (to a trusted group, friend, or counselor), or you can express feelings directly to others about whom you have the feelings. You need to learn in which situations it is appropriate to express feelings directly. You also can change your thinking in ways that result in your feeling different. For example, instead of saying, “I am so angry she doesn’t agree with me, I feel like using,” you can frame your feelings as, “It’s all right for someone not to agree with me, and using will not make anything better.” Do not let out-of-control feelings drive you back to using. Learning to cope with emotions means allowing yourself to feel and balancing an honest response with intelligent behavior.",

    "text": "3.2 Depression –\nAlthough we know drug use and depression are related, it is not always clear how the two interact. Most people in recovery report having problems with depression from time to time. Depression can be a particular problem for people who have been using stimulants. Stimulants make people feel “high” by flooding the brain with chemicals called neurotransmitters that regulate feelings of pleasure. During recovery there are periods when the brain doesn’t supply enough of those neurotransmitters. The undersupply of neurotransmitters causes a temporary feeling of depression. But this is different from being clinically depressed. For some people, depression left untreated can result in relapse. It is important to be aware of signs of depression and be prepared to cope with the feelings. If you feel that you cannot cope with your depression or if your depression lasts for a long time, seek help from a mental health professional. Your counselor or someone else at your treatment program can refer you to someone for help.\nThese are some symptoms that might indicate depression:\n\nLow energy\nOvereating or not eating\nSad thoughts\nLosing interest in career or hobbies\nSleeping more than usual\nDecreased sex drive □ Increased thoughts of drinking\nInsomnia\nStopping attendance at 12-Step or mutual-help meetings\nStopping exercise program\nAvoiding social activities\nFeelings of boredom, irritability, or anger\nCrying spells □ Suicidal thoughts or actions\nStopping normal activities such as work, cleaning house, buying groceries\n\nOption #2:\nNegative and positive emotions have an impact on the way you act and feel, which means that depression and anger can affect the choices you make and your behaviors.\nDepression, anger, and addiction are issues that are closely related. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, people with substance abuse disorders often have co-occurring mental health issues, and vice versa.1 If you or someone you care about is affected by mental health issues and substance misuse, know that addiction treatment can help you overcome addiction and improve your overall mental health.",

    "text": "12 🌊 Understanding Cravings\nAs you work on changing your drinking, it’s normal to have urges or cravings for alcohol. A craving is when you feel the strong urge to drink, even though you don’t want to. This can show up as thoughts, emotions, or physical sensations that pull you toward drinking, even if part of you wants to stay sober.\nGood news: Cravings are short-lived, predictable, and controllable. With practice, they will get weaker, and you’ll feel more confident in handling them when they pop up.\n\n12.0.1 What is a Craving?\nA craving is a powerful feeling that pushes you to drink alcohol, even when you don’t want to. It can feel like a strong mental or physical need to drink. Cravings happen because of the long-term use of alcohol, and they can last for some time after you stop drinking.\nIf you’ve had a lot of drinking in the past, cravings may come up more often or feel stronger. But don’t worry! Cravings are a normal part of recovery, and they happen at all stages of recovery.\n\n\n12.0.2 How Do Cravings Show Up?\nCravings can look different for everyone. Here are some ways cravings might show up for you:\n\nPhysical feelings: You might feel shaky, sweaty, or have a racing heart.\nThoughts: You might think, “I want a drink,” or “It would be fun to drink with my friends right now.”\nEmotions: Cravings can come with feelings like anxiety, frustration, or sadness.\nBehaviors: You might find yourself lingering near places where alcohol is sold, or spending time with others who are drinking.\n\n\n\n12.0.3 Cravings Are Predictable\nCravings don’t happen randomly. They can be triggered by certain situations or emotions. These triggers can be internal (how you’re feeling) or external (things around you).\n\nInternal triggers: These are feelings or thoughts that can bring on cravings, like stress, sadness, or even excitement. You might also feel physical discomfort, like being tired or in pain.\nExternal triggers: These are things in the environment that remind you of drinking, like seeing alcohol, being around people who drink, or even times of day when you used to drink.\n\nThe more you recognize what causes your cravings, the better you can plan for them. Understanding what triggers your cravings can help you avoid or manage them.\n\n\n12.0.4 Cravings Are Temporary\nCravings might feel intense, but here’s the important thing to remember: they don’t last long. Most cravings only last a few minutes. Think of a craving like a wave in the ocean. It starts small, gets bigger, and then crashes and disappears.\nEven though cravings can feel overwhelming at first, they are time-limited and will pass. The key is not giving in to the craving. The more you ignore the craving and choose not to drink, the weaker it becomes.\n\n\n12.0.5 Cravings Get Easier Over Time\nAt the start of your recovery, cravings may be stronger and more frequent. But over time, they will get weaker and less intense. Each time you resist the urge to drink, the craving loses power.\nStopping alcohol use completely is the fastest way to get rid of cravings. If you don’t reward craving with alcohol use, it will eventually go away. It’s like feeding a stray animal. If you stop feeding it, it will stop coming back.\n\n\n12.0.6 What Can You Do When a Craving Hits?\nWhen you feel a craving, remember: it’s temporary and you can control how you respond. Here are some ways to deal with cravings:\n\nPause and Breathe: Take a deep breath. Focus on the present moment.\nDistraction: Do something else to take your mind off the craving, like going for a walk, calling a friend, or reading a book.\nUrge Surfing: Imagine the craving is like a wave—let it build, but know it will crash and pass.\nReach Out: Talk to someone you trust, like a sponsor or a friend. Sometimes, just sharing how you feel can help.\n\n\n\n\n12.0.7 Remember: Cravings Don’t Last Forever\nIt’s completely normal to experience cravings in recovery. But the more you practice coping with them, the easier it will get. Cravings are like visitors—they come and go. With time and practice, you will get better at handling them.\nBy staying sober, even when cravings are strong, you’ll find that the cravings become less powerful and easier to ignore. You’ve got this!",

People with a history of heavier use might experience stronger or more frequent urges. Experiencing cravings is a normal part of recovery and is common across all stages of recovery.\nCravings and urges can show up in many ways, such as:\n\nPhysical sensations (e.g., sweating, heart racing, queasy stomach)\nThoughts (e.g., “A drink sounds good right now”, “I’d rather be with my friends getting drunk tonight”)\nPositive expectancies (e.g., “I would have more fun if I was drinking”)\nEmotions (e.g., anxiety, depression, irritability)\nBehaviors (e.g., pausing while passing the beer display in a store, hanging out in bars or with others who are drinking).",

    "text": "12.2 Cravings are PREDICTABLE\nCravings can occur in response to triggers (e.g. being around people or situations that remind someone of past alcohol use) or withdrawal (stopping regular use of alcohol).\nWithdrawal: Our brains begin to regulate themselves with alcohol. Without it, the brain makes chemical demands and requests for alcohol. You can expect cravings from withdrawal to be present at the beginning of recovery and diminish over time\nTriggers have to do with our memories of alcohol. Alcohol and other drugs flood our brain with reward chemicals like dopamine. Long after our last drink, our brains and memories still associate drinking with this flood of reward. When we’re exposed to a cue or stimulus that triggers those latent memories, our brains beg us for more reward chemicals. And thus a craving is born.\nCravings can be internal or external:\nInternal Situations:\n\nUnpleasant emotions (e.g., frustration, depression, anger, feeling “stressed out”)\nPleasant emotions (e.g., joy, excitement)\nPhysical feelings (e.g., sick, shaky, tense, in pain)\nThoughts about drinking (e.g., “I’ll feel better if I get drink”)\n\nExternal Situations\n\nExposure to alcohol (e.g. alcohol in the home)\nSmell, sight and sounds of other people drinking\nParticular times during the day when drinking used to occur (e.g., getting off work, weekends, payday)\nStimuli previously associated with drinking (e.g., wine glasses, bar, , ATM machine)\nStimuli previously associated with withdrawal (e.g., hospital, aspirin, morning)\n\nThe more we learn to better identify our cravings, the better we can predict them",

So in a very real sense these cravings are controllable.\nCravings tend to be stronger earlier on, then weaken, and eventually fade over time.\nEach time a person does something other than drink and/or use others drugs, the craving loses power.\nStopping alcohol and other drug use completely is the quickest way to get rid of the cravings.",
