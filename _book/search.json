Or one feelings module that provides psychoeducation about role of emotion, cognition, physiology in current experience\nMATRIX\nFeelings Can You Recognize Your Feelings? Sometimes people don’t allow themselves to have certain emotions (for example, you tell yourself, “Feeling angry is not all right”). Sometimes people aren’t honest with themselves about their emotions (for example, saying, “I’m just having a bad day,” when the truth is they’re sad). When you mislabel emotions or deny them, you cannot address them and they build up inside you. Are You Aware of Physical Signs of Certain Feelings? Maybe you get an upset stomach when you are anxious, bite your fingernails when you are stressed, or shake when you are angry. Think about the emotions that trouble you, and try to identify how they show physically. How Do You Cope With Your Feelings Now? How do you respond when you experience negative emotions? How do your feelings affect you and others around you? For instance, do your feelings interfere with your relationships with others? Do people avoid you, try to keep you from getting upset, or try to make you feel better? Focus on one or two emotions you need to cope with better. How Do You Express Your Emotions? It is important to find an appropriate way to express emotions. You can express feelings indirectly (to a trusted group, friend, or counselor), or you can express feelings directly to others about whom you have the feelings. You need to learn in which situations it is appropriate to express feelings directly. You also can change your thinking in ways that result in your feeling different. For example, instead of saying, “I am so angry she doesn’t agree with me, I feel like using,” you can frame your feelings as, “It’s all right for someone not to agree with me, and using will not make anything better.” Do not let out-of-control feelings drive you back to using. Learning to cope with emotions means allowing yourself to feel and balancing an honest response with intelligent behavior.\nDepression –\nAlthough we know drug use and depression are related, it is not always clear how the two interact. Most people in recovery report having problems with depression from time to time. Depression can be a particular problem for people who have been using stimulants. Stimulants make people feel “high” by flooding the brain with chemicals called neurotransmitters that regulate feelings of pleasure. During recovery there are periods when the brain doesn’t supply enough of those neurotransmitters. The undersupply of neurotransmitters causes a temporary feeling of depression. But this is different from being clinically depressed. For some people, depression left untreated can result in relapse. It is important to be aware of signs of depression and be prepared to cope with the feelings. If you feel that you cannot cope with your depression or if your depression lasts for a long time, seek help from a mental health professional. Your counselor or someone else at your treatment program can refer you to someone for help. These are some symptoms that might indicate depression. Check all that apply to you: 2 of 3 RP 29 Coping With Feelings and Depression □ Low energy □ Overeating or not eating □ Sad thoughts □ Losing interest in career or hobbies □ Sleeping more than usual □ Decreased sex drive □ Increased thoughts of drinking □ Insomnia □ Stopping attendance at 12-Step or mutual-help meetings □ Stopping exercise program □ Avoiding social activities □ Feelings of boredom, irritability, or anger □ Crying spells □ Suicidal thoughts or actions □ Stopping normal activities such as work, cleaning house, buying groceries",

The words “urge” and “craving” refer to a broad range of thoughts, physical sensations, or emotions that tempt you to drink, even though you have at least some desire not to. You may feel an uncomfortable pull in two directions or sense a loss of control.\nFortunately, urges to drink are short-lived, predictable, and controllable. With time, and by practicing new responses, you’ll find that your urges to drink will lose strength, and you’ll gain confidence in your ability to deal with urges that may still arise at times.\nHere are some important facts about craving to keep in mind as you begin to work with identifying and coping with urges during recovery:",

People with a history of heavier use might experience stronger or more frequent urges.

Without it, the brain makes chemical demands and requests for alcohol. You can expect cravings from withdrawal to be present at the beginning of recovery and diminish over time\nTriggers have to do with our memories of alcohol. Alcohol and other drugs flood our brain with reward chemicals like dopamine. Long after our last drink, our brains and memories still associate drinking with this flood of reward. When we’re exposed to a cue or stimulus that triggers those latent memories, our brains beg us for more reward chemicals. And thus a craving is born.\nCravings can be internal or external:\nInternal Situations:\n\nUnpleasant emotions (e.g., frustration, depression, anger, feeling “stressed out”)\nPleasant emotions (e.g., joy, excitement)\nPhysical feelings (e.g., sick, shaky, tense, in pain)\nThoughts about drinking (e.g., “I’ll feel better if I get drink”)\n\nExternal Situations\n\nExposure to alcohol (e.g. alcohol in the home)\nSmell, sight and sounds of other people drinking\nParticular times during the day when drinking used to occur (e.g., getting off work, weekends, payday)\nStimuli previously associated with drinking (e.g., wine glasses, bar, , ATM machine)\nStimuli previously associated with withdrawal (e.g., hospital, aspirin, morning)\n\nThe more we learn to better identify our cravings, the better we can predict them",

Each individual wave never lasts more than a few minutes. A craving is just the same. It starts off small and then builds up. But it peaks, just like a wave, and will eventually break and disappear. This whole process usually doesn’t last more than minutes. Cravings are time-limited.\nCravings will lose their power if they are not reinforced by using or drinking in response. Even if use occurs only once in a while, it will still keep those cravings alive. Cravings are like stray animals – keep feeding them and they will keep coming back. So in a very real sense these cravings are controllable.\nCravings tend to be stronger earlier on, then weaken, and eventually fade over time.\nEach time a person does something other than drink and/or use others drugs, the craving loses power.\nStopping alcohol and other drug use completely is the quickest way to get rid of the cravings.",

At about 6 weeks into the recovery process, many people return to alcohol use. Has your addicted brain played with the idea? These are some of the most common arguments against stopping the use of alcohol and answers to the arguments. I came here to stop using speed, not to stop drinking. Part of stopping methamphetamine use is stopping all substance use, including alcohol use. I’ve had drinks and not used, so it doesn’t make any difference. Drinking over time greatly increases the risk of relapse. A single drink does not necessarily cause relapse any more than a single cigarette causes lung cancer. However, with continued drinking, the risks of relapse greatly increase. Drinking actually helps. When I have a craving, a drink calms me down, and the craving goes away. Alcohol interferes with the brain’s chemical healing process. Continued alcohol use eventually intensifies cravings, even if one drink seems to reduce cravings. I’m not an alcoholic, so why do I need to stop drinking? If you’re not an alcoholic, you should have no problem stopping alcohol use. If you can’t stop, maybe alcohol is more of a problem than you realize. I’m never going to use drugs again, but I’m not sure I’ll never drink again. Make a 6-month commitment to total abstinence. Give yourself the chance to make a decision about alcohol with a drug-free brain. If you reject alcohol abstinence because “forever” scares you, then you’re justifying drinking now and risking relapse to substance use.\nMotivation for recovery\n“Fear will get people into treatment, but fear alone is not enough to keep them in recovery”\nAsk any group of people who are new to recovery why they want to stop using right now and you will get many different answers: ● I was arrested, and it’s either this or jail. ● My wife says if I don’t stop, we are finished. ● Last time I used I thought I was going to die; I know I’ll die if I use again. ● They are going to take the children from us unless we stop. ● I’ve been using for 20 years now; it’s time to change. Which of the people quoted is most likely to be successful in recovery? It seems logical to think that people who want to stop using for themselves and not because someone else wants them to are more likely to do well in treatment. However, that may not be true. Research shows that the reasons people stop using don’t predict whether they will be able to lead substance-free lives. What does make a difference is whether they can stay substance free long enough to appreciate the benefits of a different lifestyle. When debts are not overwhelming, relationships are rewarding, work is going well, and health is good, the person in recovery wants to stay abstinent.\nRelapse justification\nOnce a person decides not to use drugs anymore, how does that person end up using again? Do relapses happen completely by accident? Or are there warning signs and ways to avoid relapse? Relapse justification is a process that happens in people’s minds. A person may have decided to stop using, but the person’s brain is still healing and still feels the need for the substances. The addicted brain invents excuses that allow the person in recovery to edge close enough to relapse situations that accidents can happen. You may remember a time when you intended to stay drug free but you invented a justification for using, and before you knew it, you had used again. Understanding and anticipating the justifications help you interrupt the process. Use the questions below to help you identify justifications you might be susceptible to. Substance Dependence Is Cured Has your addicted brain ever convinced you that you could use just once or use just a little? For example, have you said any of the following? ● I’m back in control. I’ll be able to stop when I want to. ● I’ve learned my lesson. I’ll only use small amounts and only once in a while. ● This substance was not my problem—stimulants were. So I can use this and not relapse. ● Other: ______________________________________________\nTesting Yourself It’s very easy to forget that being smart, not being strong, is the key to staying abstinent. Have you ever wanted to prove you could be stronger than drugs? For example, have you said any of the following? ● I’m strong enough to be around it now. ● I want to see whether I can say “No” to drinking and using. ● I want to see whether I can be around my old friends. ● I want to see how the high feels now that I’ve stopped using. ● Other: ______________________________________________ Celebrating You may be encouraged by other people or your addicted brain to make an exception to your abstinence. Have you ever tried to justify using with the following thoughts? ● I’m feeling really good. One time won’t hurt. ● I’m on vacation. I’ll go back to not using when I get home. ● I’m doing so well. Things are going great. I owe myself a reward. ● This is such a special event that I want to celebrate. ● Other: ______________________________________________ What might you do when confronted with these excuses to use?",

Stress is the experience people have when the demands they make on themselves or those placed on them disrupt their lives. Sometimes we are unaware of this emotional state until the stress produces physical symptoms. Place a checkmark next to any of the following problems you have experienced in the past 30 days: □ Sleep problems (for example, difficulty falling asleep, waking up off and on during the night, nightmares, waking up early and being unable to fall back to sleep) □ Headaches □ Irritability □ Stomach problems □ Difficulty concentrating □ Chronic illness □ General dissatisfaction with life □ Fatigue □ Feeling overwhelmed □ Moodiness If you checked two or more of these items, you may need to make some changes in your life to reduce the level of stress. Becoming more aware of stress is the first step to reducing it. You may have been accustomed to turning to substance use in times of stress. Learning new ways to cope with stress is part of the recovery process. Another Relapse Prevention session will address techniques for reducing stress.",
